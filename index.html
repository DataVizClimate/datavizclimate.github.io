        <p>Although the globe is seeing rising temperatures, sea level and tides, they won't rise forever. Global efforts have been made to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and slow the rate of climate change. In 2021, the United States was readmitted into the Paris Agreement, an international treaty aimed at addressing issues of climate change, under an executive order signed by President Biden. The state of Hawaii aims to have 100% of its electricity generated to be from renewable sources by 2045. As of 2022, Hawaii has 29% of its energy from renewables. Although it sounds like a lofty goal, some countries already have 100% of their electricity generated by renewable sources. Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay obtain all their electricity from renewable sources. The future upon the horizon is brighter than it may seem.</p>
